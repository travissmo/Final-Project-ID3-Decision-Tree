# Final Project – ID3 Decision Tree: Weather Classification

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning implementation using the ID3 decision tree algorithm in Python.

## Overview

The dataset used contains weather observations, including wind direction, cloud cover, and other relevant features. The goal of the project is to predict whether rainfall will occur ("Yes" or "No") based on those attributes.

### Key Steps:

- Data cleaning and transformation using Python and Pandas
- Conversion of numeric values to categorical for compatibility with decision tree logic
- Manual implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm
- Visual representation of the decision tree using `graphviz`
- A premade `make_tree.py` module is used to support the tree-building logic and visualization
- All development and testing were completed within a Jupyter Notebook environment

## Files Included

- `WeatherDecisionTree.ipynb` – Main notebook containing data prep and execution
- `make_tree.py` – Python module to generate and visualize the ID3 decision tree
- `WeatherDecisionTreePDFNotebook.pdf` – PDF export of the notebook for easier viewing
- `weather.csv` – Dataset used in the analysis

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure `make_tree.py` and `weather.csv` are in the same directory.
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to reproduce the results and tree visualization.
